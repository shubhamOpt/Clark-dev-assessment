Since the ask is to create two different components, so creating these two components are the main two tasks that will be divided into further sub-tasks. 
Each functionality, be it displaying the records on initialisation, adding pagination logic, adding sorting logic will be treated as separate tasks and will have their own separate methods.
Adding Lightning messaging service enable cross-DOM communication between the components can be treated as a stand-alone task as well.
